# Contributing

Hi, thank you in advance for your help. These resources will be used in classrooms around the world to teach essential job skills.

Please read [Fighting Poverty with Code](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/fighting-poverty-with-code-d1ed3ebd982d) and [The Cure for Homelessness](https://medium.com/end-homelessness/the-cure-for-homelessness-83ef0d621c71) to learn how this project got started.

We're primarily interested in a few types of content. You'll tell us what kind of content you're contributing by adding a hashtag at the end - like Twitter or Facebook. =)

* Video Shorter is better. 5-15 minutes works best. #video
* Long Video. Is your video over 15 minutes? Use hashtag: #long_video
* Book. Only add books that are available for free online. #book
* Article. Blog post? Book excerpt. Paper? The hashtag you want is #article
* Tutorial. A tutorial is a mix of text content and instructions for the reader to follow. #tutorial
* Exercises. Just like tutuorials, but exercises tell the student when something is wrong and let them try to fix it. e.g. [learnrx](http://jhusain.github.io/learnrx/) #exercises
* Project. A resource that describes a project for a student and lets the student complete it. #project
* Game. A game designed to teach the student how to do something. #game
* Community. An online place for students to meet other people interested in the topic so they can learn from each other. #community
* News. A resource that lets the student track current developments about the topic. #news
